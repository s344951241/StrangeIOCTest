\subsection{Detailed Description}
The {\ttfamily \mbox{[}\hyperlink{class_post_construct}{Post\-Construct}\mbox{]}} attribute marks one or more methods as Post\-Constructors. 

A Post\-Constructor is triggered immediately after injection. This allows you to use use a Post\-Constructor in much the same way as a Constructor, safe in the knowledge that there will be no null pointers on injected dependencies. Post\-Constructors do not accept arguments.
